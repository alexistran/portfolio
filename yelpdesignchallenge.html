			  		<p id="header">USER RESEARCH</p>
			  		<p>As I had not been to the zoo since 7th grade, and I was visiting home for a week (San Diego), I decided to put myself in the shoes of someone planning a trip to the zoo and go. This was extremely helpful as I was able to dispel incorrect assumptions I had made prior to visiting.</p>
		 		</div>

		  		<div class="col-12">
		  			<div class="interview-guide">
		  				<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 1: Which zoo to go to?</b></p>
		  				<p>I began by googling through different sites for the best zoo near me.<br>What I looked at:</p>
			  			<ul>
				  			<li>Reviews from other people</li>
				  			<li>The types of animals the zoo had</li>
				  			<li>Current attractions</li>
				  			<li>Price</li>
			  			</ul>
			  			<br>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 2: Buying my ticket</b></p>
			  			<p>After deciding on a zoo, I tried to look for additional discounts I could get on the ticket. I looked on various sites, such as Groupon and Yelp, and eventually found a AAA discount that got me a few dollars off.</p>
			  			<br>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 3: Packing for the trip</b></p>
			  			<p>Not knowing what was allowed or not inside, I searched it up on the official zoo site, and also looked at other people's blogs to see what they recommended. I packed sunscreen, a hat, water, and snacks.</p>
			  			<br>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 4: Getting to the zoo and parking</b></p>
			  			<p>This part was pretty straight forward. I wasn't familiar with the area, but Google Maps directed me right into the parking lot. The hard part was remembering where I parked for after because they labelled it in a fairly unintuitive way. I was somewhere between koala 3 and toucan 5.</p>
			  			<br>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 5: Getting inside</b></p>
			  			<p>I was digging deep into my emails at the entrance of the zoo and then realized they didn't email me my tickets. I had to go into the ticket line and ask someone to print out my tickets. This defeated the whole point of buying the ticket online.</p>
			  			<br>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 6: What to do inside?</b></p>
			  			<p>I didn’t plan out what I was going to do there the night before because searching for the zoo gave me a general idea of what the zoo had to offer.<br><br><img src="images/yelp/map.JPG"><br>The first thing you see when you walk inside is a huge map. It was pretty overwhelming and I had no idea where to start. A zoo volunteer there recommended that I take the bus tour that gives an overview of the zoo, and then walk around to see my favorites after.

			  		<p id="header">IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS</p>
			  		<p>While at the zoo, I interviewed 3 families at the zoo (1 from Indonesia, 1 from Washington state, and 1 that was local), a few volunteer workers there, and I also interviewed 4 of my friends who have been to the zoo before to understand the current zoo experience and how they plan their trips. ​​​​​​​</p><br>

							<p id="header">TAKEAWAYS + FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS</p>
							<p><b>If possible, try to experience it first hand</b></p>
							<p>It was immensely helpful to go through the current process of planning a zoo trip on my own. This allowed me to not only understand the current pain points, but also gave me the ability to go to the zoo and talk to people first-hand about their experiences. I was able to dispel a few incorrect assumptions through this.<br><br> <b>In the future</b><br><br>I want to figure out how to make this app more <b>accessible</b>. I made some text larger so that it would be easy to read, but some pages can be dense with information-- I want to figure out how to <b>break down the text for people who would find it harder to focus</b>. For those who are blind or have a visual disability, I could also incorporate an <b>audio assistant</b> to read out the facts. Adding a map feature to show the <b>best path for wheelchair users</b> or other people who may have difficulty walking steep or uneven paths could benefit many. Something I can also implement in the future is the ability to hide the popular attractions/your selections so that the map has <b>more visibility</b>, which can improve the map viewing experience. My design is also based on the assumption that everyone has access to the internet, but having access to <b>consistent internet</b> is not always the case. A getaround might be to locally store map data as soon as you select the zoo, or <b>create a "lite" version</b> of the application.<br><br> The focus of my design was on the zoo-going customer, but in the future I would also want to design for the other potential user-- the zoos. There is a lot of potential for what zoo employees can do on a zoo application, for example, updating zoo information and exhibits, or interacting with customers.</p>
