			  		<p>As I had not been to the zoo since 7th grade, and I was visiting home for a week (San Diego), I decided to put myself in the shoes of someone planning a trip to the zoo and go. This was extremely helpful as I was able to dispel incorrect assumptions I had made prior to visiting.</p>

		  				<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 1: Which zoo to go to?</b></p>
		  				<p>I began by googling through different sites for the best zoo near me.<br>What I looked at:</p>
			  			<ul>
				  			<li>Reviews from other people</li>
				  			<li>The types of animals the zoo had</li>
				  			<li>Current attractions</li>
				  			<li>Price</li>
			  			</ul>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 2: Buying my ticket</b></p>
			  			<p>After deciding on a zoo, I tried to look for additional discounts I could get on the ticket. I looked on various sites, such as Groupon and Yelp, and eventually found a AAA discount that got me a few dollars off.</p>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 3: Packing for the trip</b></p>
			  			<p>Not knowing what was allowed or not inside, I searched it up on the official zoo site, and also looked at other people's blogs to see what they recommended. I packed sunscreen, a hat, water, and snacks.</p>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 4: Getting to the zoo and parking</b></p>
			  			<p>This part was pretty straight forward. I wasn't familiar with the area, but Google Maps directed me right into the parking lot. The hard part was remembering where I parked for after because they labelled it in a fairly intuitive way. I was somewhere between koala 3 and toucan 5.</p>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 5: Getting inside</b></p>
			  			<p>I was digging deep into my emails at the entrance of the zoo and then realized they didn't email me my tickets. I had to go into the ticket line and ask someone to print out my tickets. This defeated the whole point of buying the ticket online.</p>

			  			<p class="i-g-header"><b>Step 6: What to do inside?</b></p>
			  			<p>I didn’t plan out what I was going to do there the night before because searching for the zoo gave me a general idea of what the zoo had to offer.<br><br><img src="images/yelp/map.JPG"><br>The first thing you see when you walk inside is a huge map. It was pretty overwhelming and I had no idea where to start. A zoo volunteer there recommended that I take the bus tour that gives an overview of the zoo, and then walk around to see my favorites after.

			  		<p id="header">IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS</p>
			  		<p>While at the zoo, I interviewed 3 families at the zoo (1 from Indonesia, 1 from Washington state, and 1 that was local), a few volunteer workers there, and I also interviewed 4 of my friends who have been to the zoo before to understand the current zoo experience and how they plan their trips. ​​​​​​​</p>
			  		<p id="header">KEY INSIGHTS</p>
			  		<p>I gathered key insights from my research online, planning out my own trip, and interviewing other people. These key insights helped influence my design decisions.​​​​​​​</p>
