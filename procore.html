					<p>Many people depend on public transportation to get to their destination in a timely manner. Being late can be very detrimental, especially when your job depends on you being on time.</p><br>

					<p id="header">USER RESEARCH</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-7">
					<p>To understand how people currently utilize public transportation, I conducted casual, semi-structured interviews with 6 people. <br><br>
					Some sample questions include:<br>
					What transportation methods do you currently take, which do you prefer, and why?
					Can you walk me through your process of getting to a destination on time?
					What would you do in the situation of there being a delay in the train/bus?

				<div class="col-7">
					<br><br>
					<p><b>KEY PROBLEMS</b></p>
					<p>After talking to these people, I created a list of problems that most people have with getting to places on time and with public transportation. This list of problems helped me stay focused on solving for the user and aided me in my design decisions. <br><br>
					1. People are late because they don’t know when to leave, to make it to the right train/bus.<br><br>
					2. You make it to the station on time, but don’t have enough money in your transit card, and getting in line to refill it can make you miss your train.<br><br>
					3. When it’s really crowded, you don’t know which car of the train you should to enter on. <br><br>
					4. Weather conditions can cause delays. <br><br>
					5. Large external events such as sports events and protests can cause delays. <br><br>
					6. The train can temporarily stop working when you don’t expect it, which means you need to find an alternative.<br><br>
					7. The station can unexpectedly close for dangerous reasons.<br><br>
					These can be grouped into two overarching categories: personal delays (1-3) and external delays(4-7).

					<p id="header">COMPETITIVE RESEARCH</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-7">
					<p>I looked at other popular transit applications that people used to help them get to their destination on time. I wanted to dissect their strengths and weaknesses, and see what I could draw from and what I could improve on. 
					</p><br>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<center><img src="images/procore/apps.png"></center>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
				</div>
				<div class="col-7">
					<br><br>
					<p><b>KEY FINDINGS</b></p>
					<p>
					A common feature amongst all of these apps that I found very useful was that they all let you request a ride-sharing car from within the app if you prefer, or in case you missed the train/bus. Real-time data is incredibly important, but I think something these popular apps don’t have is showing where on the map the train/bus currently is, which could benefit people further.<br><br>
					I found that in all of these popular transit applications, most of them are focused on finding out the best way for right now instead of also putting in similar effort for the future. Planning for the future is the best way to not be late, so I found a design opportunity here that I could focus on to be my competitive advantage.

					<p id="header">INITIAL BRAINSTORMING + SKETCHES</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-7">
					<p>I began by figuring out what features I wanted the application to have, keeping in mind the the causes for a person to be late that I derived from my user research. Then I sketched my ideas out on paper.

					<p id="header">WIREFRAMES</p>

				<div class="col-7">
					<p>After iterating on the concept and getting feedback, I then felt confident enough to move my ideas off the paper and into a digital wireframe.

					<p id="header">HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-7">
					<p>INVISION PROTOTYPE<br><br>
					I chose to use a full-screen navigation instead of tabs to create a more immersive experience that flowed more naturally. No tabs allows the user to really focus on the task at hand, which is getting to a destination on time.

					I think implementing a way to scan a virtual transit card would decrease the amount of time fumbling through a wallet or bag for a physical transit card. </p>
