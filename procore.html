					<p id="header">USER RESEARCH</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-7">
					<p>To understand how people currently utilize public transportation, I conducted casual, semi-structured interviews with 6 people. <br><br>
					Some sample questions include:<br>
					What transportation methods do you currently take, which do you prefer, and why?
					Can you walk me through your process of getting to a destination on time?
					What would you do in the situation of there being a delay in the train/bus?

				<div class="col-7">
					<br><br>
					<p><b>KEY PROBLEMS</b></p>
					<p>After talking to these people, I created a list of problems that most people have with getting to places on time and with public transportation. This list of problems helped me stay focused on solving for the user and aided me in my design decisions. <br><br>
					1. People are late because they don’t know when to leave, to make it to the right train/bus.<br><br>
					2. You make it to the station on time, but don’t have enough money in your transit card, and getting in line to refill it can make you miss your train.<br><br>
					3. When it’s really crowded, you don’t know which car of the train you should to enter on. <br><br>
					4. Weather conditions can cause delays. <br><br>
					5. Large external events such as sports events and protests can cause delays. <br><br>
					6. The train can temporarily stop working when you don’t expect it, which means you need to find an alternative.<br><br>
					7. The station can unexpectedly close for dangerous reasons.

					<p id="header">COMPETITIVE RESEARCH</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-7">
					<p>I looked at other popular transit applications that people used to help them get to their destination on time. I wanted to dissect their strengths and weaknesses, and see what I could draw from and what I could improve on. 
					</p><br>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<center><img src="images/procore/apps.png"></center>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
				</div>
				<div class="col-7">
					<br><br>
					<p><b>KEY FINDINGS</b></p>
					<p>
					A common feature amongst all of these apps that I found very useful was that they all let you request a ride-sharing car from within the app if you prefer or in case you missed the train/bus. Real-time data is incredibly important, but I think something these popular apps don’t have is showing where on the map the train/bus is, which could benefit people further.<br><br>
					I found that out of all of these popular transit applications, none of them worked with your preexisting calendar. Most of them are focused on finding out the best way for right now instead of also considering the future. Planning for the future is the best way to not be late, so I found a design opportunity here.
