				    <p id="overview-header">OVERVIEW<p>
				    <p id="overview">In Spring 2016, I participated in and won first place in the Berkeley Builds hackathon. Each team was partnered up with a non-profit organization and my team was partnered up with BAWAR (Bay Area Women Against Rape). We decided to create a messaging app that would allow victims to reach out to counselors anonymously online to get the help that they need. <br><br>I played a role in coding the backend and front end of the web application (HTML, CSS, Meteor.js). Due to the limited time (2 days) and my focus on learning a new framework, I didn't have time to think about the design. Once I learned more about design and design thinking, I wanted to take on the challenge of redesigning this application as I saw potential for improvement. <br><br>The original hackathon project is viewable <a href="http://bawarchat.herokuapp.com/" class="link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

			  		<p><b>How do I make it easier for people who have undergone sexual violence to have access to help?</b></p>
			  		<p>This was the problem space my team was given. During the hackathon my team came up with the idea of creating a messaging app that people would be able to access through the BAWAR site, that would allow them to anonymously talk to a counselor. There is a hotline that exists, but it might not be easy to verbalize what has happened to you. It's also not as discreet to talk to someone to get help, if you live in a shared place where you can get overheard.​​​​​​​<br><br></p>

		  			<p id="header">THE SOLUTION</p>
		  			<p>Med Reminder is a mobile app that simplifies and aids the medication taking experience. By using a device that people regularly use, we can tackle <b>irregular medication use</b>. This app is an effective reminder that people can conveniently incorporate into their daily busy lives. It not only provides medication reminders, but also streamlines other aspects of taking medication that may contribute to one not being able to take a medication on time. 
The design goal is to be simplistic and purposeful. In addition to the app, a push notification will be sent at the appropriate times to remind you to take your medication. </p><br>

							<p><b>Work within constraints.</b></p>
							<p>As this was the final project for my human centered design course, there were time limitations. If I had more time, I would like to conduct more user interviews. I'd like to continue iterating on the final prototype, to see how it could be further useful to people-- specifically interviewing more older generations because they are the ones taking the most medication but may not be the most tech savvy. Knowing my constraints helped me think about what I could realistically achieve, but also think beyond and ideate on how to make the impossible possible. </p>
							<br>
							<p><b>Improve through iterations.</b></p>
							<p>The final solution can take many different tries to get to. Having a perfect solution right off the bat is highly unlikely, and getting feedback helped a lot in getting to where I am, which isn't perfect, but it's the process that matters. I had to make design decisions to find a middle ground between convenience and several potentially helpful features, which is a decision I didn't even know I had to make when I started. Iterating helps me reach the small details to create a delightful user experience. 
			In addition, through later usability tests on my final prototype, I was able to gain a perspective I had not realized before. Privacy was a concern that did not occur to me as I was designing the app. Moving forward, I want to figure out how to incorporate more privacy into my apps, such as adding a pin code or password to gain access to the list of medications.</p>
							<br>
							<p><b>What is success?</b></p>
							<p>A key performance indicator that I would use to measure the success of this app is if the amount of missed medications is significantly reduced from before they started using the app. ​​​​</p>
