		      <p id="overview">For individuals who have a medication regimen, one of the biggest challenges is <b>being consistent with taking their medication</b>, making sure that they remember to take it on time. Whether it’s because there’s too many medications to track, or simply forgetfulness, this is an issue because the medication is often crucial to the individual’s well-being. There needs to be a solution that can be seamlessly integrated into people's daily lives such that the problem of irregular medication taking is eliminated.<br><br>For the final project in my human centered design course, I worked to create a solution that would make remembering to take medication be an easier experience for people.</p>

		  		<p>Through conducting secondary research, and seeing users use these products, I was able to validate a need for a solution to the original problem. While there are existing products that attempt to aid the medication taking experience, they either did not do enough, or had too much functionality that it was an overwhelming experience. My goal is to create a solution with a balance between both. ​​​​​​​</p>

		  		<p id="header">THE SOLUTION</p>
		  		<p>Med Reminder is a mobile app that simplifies and aids the medication taking experience. By using a device that people regularly use, we can tackle irregular medication use. This app is an effective reminder that people can conveniently incorporate into their daily busy lives. It not only provides medication reminders, but also streamlines other aspects of taking medication that may contribute to one not being able to take a medication on time. 
The design goal is to be simplistic and purposeful. In addition to the app, a push notification will be sent at the appropriate times to remind you to take your medication. </p>

				<p><b>Work within constraints.</b></p>
				<p>As this was the final project for my human centered design course, there were time limitations. If I had more time, I would like to conduct more user interviews. I'd like to continue iterating on the final prototype, to see how it could be further useful to people-- specifically interviewing more older generations because they are the ones taking the most medication but may not be the most tech savvy. Knowing my constraints helped me think about what I could realistically achieve, but also think beyond and ideate on how to make the impossible possible. </p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Improve through iterations.</b></p>
				<p>The final solution can take many different tries to get to. Having a perfect solution right off the bat is highly unlikely, and getting feedback helped a lot in getting to where I am, which isn't perfect, but it's the process that matters. I had to make design decisions to find a middle ground between convenience and several potentially helpful features, which is a decision I didn't even know I had to make when I started. Iterating helps me reach the small details to create a delightful user experience. 
In addition, through later usability tests on my final prototype, I was able to gain a perspective I had not realized before. Privacy was a concern that did not occur to me as I was designing the app. Moving forward, I want to figure out how to incorporate more privacy into my apps, such as adding a pin code or password to gain access to the list of medications.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>What is success?</b></p>
				<p>A key performance indicator that I would use to measure the success of this app is if the amount of missed medications is significantly reduced from before they started using the app. ​​​​</p>
